Description
===========
This is a windows port of the original open-sourced OpenInventor version released
by SGI. (see http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor )
This port was done at end of August 2000.
I recently (November 2000) imported some CVS changes from oss.sgi.com.

OS: 
    Windows family 95/98/Me/NT/2000 (tested!)
    SGI IRIX (tested version: 6.5 [6.5.6f and 6.5.9f])
    Linux (this modified version is untested, but should work) 

Compiler: 
    Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6.0 (SP4 highly recommended!)
    SGI Irix: MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.3.1m (older versions should be ok)
    Linux: gcc (untested)

Additional Library (not included):
    Qt (THE cross-platform C++ GUI framework) http://www.trolltech.com/
    Windows: Educational and evaluation versions are for FREE!
             There is also a windows version of the GUI binding library for Inventor
             called SoWin. Unfortunately this lib was not in a state that I would call
             'working'. Therefore I decided to use SoQt. You may want to try to use SoWin.
             see http://www.coin3d.org/
    Unix: just get the source, configure, compile and install it. don't forget
          to set the environment variables (e.g. QTDIR and LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
    
Used libs and programs (included in the misc directory. only neccessary for WINDOWS!):
make-3.79-3 (needed to compile the freetype library)
freetype2-beta8 (to decode fonts)
libFL (to wrap libFL calls from the original SGI implementation)
ft2demos (just to test the freetype lib. not needed by inventor)
jpeg-6b (to use jpeg files as textures)
SoQt (to render inventor scene-graphs and handle events, sensors ....)
SGI OpenSource Inventor (thanks SGI for releasing it as open-source!)

Installation instructions
=========================
Windows
=======
Get the Qt Library from http://www.trolltech.com/ (it's possible to get a free version!)
Unzip this package. (use an unzipper. e.g. winzip: http://www.winzip.com/ )
Open a command prompt and cd into the created inventor directory.
Call vcvars32.bat and include the path to the qt dir into the following
environment variables: lib, include and path. QTDIR is automatically set
by qt setup. If not, set it to the base directory of qt.
This port uses the freetype library and a libFL wrapper to decode fonts.
Copy a font file of your choice to a file named Utopia-Regular in your windows system
directory (the example below assumes c:\winnt\fonts. You may want to set 
the environment variable FL_FONT_PATH to a different directory).
Finally call build_all.bat.

An example session (assuming that qtlib is installed in c:\program files\qtlib):
C:\inventor>vcvars32
Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual C++ tools.
C:\inventor>set include=%include%;c:\program files\qtlib\include
C:\inventor>set lib=%lib%;c:\program files\qtlib\lib
C:\inventor>set path=%path%;c:\program files\qtlib\bin
C:\inventor>copy c:\winnt\fonts\times.ttf c:\winnt\fonts\Utopia-Regular
C:\inventor>build_all

If compiling fails you probably forgot to call vcvars32.bat or to set the
environment variables!

IRIX
====
Get the Qt Library from http://www.trolltech.com/ (It's free for Unix/X11)
and install it. Set the required environment variables.
Unzip this package. (use an unzipper. e.g. info-zip. http://freeware.sgi.com/ )
cd into the inventor directory.
Set the OIVHOME and IVROOT variables.
Both default to: unzip_directory/inventor/install
Be sure that QTDIR is set.
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH

example (assuming /usr/local was your unzip directory):
OIVHOME=/usr/local/inventor/install
IVROOT=$OIVHOME
export OIVHOME IVROOT
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OIVHOME/lib:$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH=$OIVHOME/lib:$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH

Execute ./build_all
SoQt is preconfigured for standard IRIX and Qt installations.
If compiling of SoQt fails execute the following commands:
cd inventor/build/SoQt
gmake distclean
CC=cc CXX=CC ./configure --without-coin --with-inventor=yes --prefix=$OIVHOME/install
--disable-debug --with-qt=$QTDIR
gmake

If you don't have gmake you can grab a pre-compiled version from http://freeware.sgi.com/


Usage:
======
Windows: I have included a sample file in SoGuiExamples/components.
These are samples from SoQt and are useful to test things. You may have to modify the
Visual Studio project file settings to reflect your directory structure.
Irix: Be sure to set the environment variables and that this compiled version
of OpenInventor and SoQt is used.
Windows+Irix: I recommend that you use the files in inventor/install/lib and
              inventor/install/include to compile applications.
The source for the tools of OpenInventor has been included but not project files or modified
versions of makefiles. It's not too complicated to setup your own project files and compile
the tools and examples.

Have fun,
Gerd, the inventor nerd

P.s:
If you find some 'strange' looking modifications in the code:
Ignore them. These are maybe tweaks to get maximum performance for DIV.
Huh, whats that?
DIV is short for Distributed OpenInventor.
see http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vr/div/
or http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vr/studierstube/multidim/
I will make an opensource version available in the near future.
Please don't ask me for an old version.
