<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>This class contains detail information about a point on a line segment in a vertexbased shape made of line segments. The information includes the points at the endsof the segment, and the index of the segment within the shape.

<dt>METHODS
<dl>
<dt><b>SoLineDetail</b>()
<dt>virtual ~<b>SoLineDetail</b>()
<dd>Constructor and destructor.

<dt>const SoPointDetail *<b>getPoint0</b>() const
<dt>const SoPointDetail *<b>getPoint1</b>() const
<dd>These return information about the two points forming the end vertices ofthe line segment, represented as an SoPointDetail.

<dt>long <b>getLineIndex</b>() const
<dd>Returns the index of the line the segment is part of within a shape, such as the third line within an SoLineSet.

<dt>long <b>getPartIndex</b>() const
<dd>Returns the index of the part containing the line segment within the shape.

<dd>Usually, the part index is the same as the line segment index, such as thefifth segment overall within an SoLineSet.

<dt>static SoType <b>getClassTypeId</b>()
<dd>Returns type identifier for this class.

<dt><b>Methods from class SoDetail</b>:
<dd>copy, getTypeId, isOfType
