<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>This node represents a 3D shape formed by constructing faces (polygons) fromvertices located at the current coordinates. SoFaceSet uses the current coordinates inorder, starting at the index specified by the startIndex field. Each face has a number of vertices specified by a value in the numVertices field. For example, an SoFaceSetwith a startIndex of 3 and numVertices of [3,4,2] would use coordinates 3, 4, and 5 for the first face, coordinates 6, 7, 8, and 9 for the second face, and coordinates 10and 11 for the third. If the last value in the numVertices field is SO_FACE_SET_USE_REST_OF_VERTICES (-1), all remaining coordinates in thecurrent coordinates are used as the vertices of the last face.

The number of values in the numVertices field indicates the number of faces in theset. The coordinates of the face set are transformed by the current cumulativetransformation. The faces are drawn with the current light model and drawing style. Treatment of the current material and normal binding is as follows:

<dl>
<dd>The PER_PART and PER_FACE bindings specify a material or normal for each face.
<dd>The _INDEXED bindings are equivalent to their non-indexed counterparts.
<dd>The DEFAULT materialbinding is equal to OVERALL.
<dd>The DEFAULT normal binding is equal to PER_VERTEX.
</dl>

<p>The startIndex is also used for materials, normals, or texturecoordinates when the binding indicates that they should be used per vertex. If the current complexity value is less than 0.5, some faces will be skipped during rendering.

<dt>ACTION BEHAVIOR
<dl>
<dt>SoGLRenderAction
<dd>Draws faces based on the current coordinates, normals, materials, drawingstyle, and so on.

<dt>SoRayPickAction
<dd>Picks faces based on the current coordinates and transformation. Details about the intersection are returned in an SoFaceDetail.

<dt>SoGetBoundingBoxAction
<dd>Computes the bounding box that encloses all vertices of the face set with the current transformation applied to them. Sets the center to the average ofthe coordinates of all vertices.

<dt>SoCallbackAction
<dd>If any triangle callbacks are registered with the action, they will be invokedfor each successive triangle generated from each face in the set.
