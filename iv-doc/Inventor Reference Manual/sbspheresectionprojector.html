<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>SbSphereSectionProjector projects a window space point (usually based on the mouse location) onto the section of a sphere that has been sliced by a plane. Two projected points can produce a rotation about the sphere's center. The tolerance slice can be specified as a fraction of the radius of the sphere. The projection pointwill not extend beyond the sliced portion of the sphere. Incremental changes (delta rotation) can be computed during interactive sessions.Sphere projectors are typically used to write interactive 3D manipulators and viewers.

<dt>METHODS

<dl>
<dt>SbSphereSectionProjector(float edgeTol = .9, SbBool orientToEye = TRUE)
<dt>SbSphereSectionProjector(const SbSphere &sph, float edgeTol = .9, SbBool orientToEye = TRUE)
<dd>Constructors. The first uses a default sphere centered at the origin with radius 1.0; the sphere is supplied in the second. The position of the plane which slices the sphere into a section is specified as a fraction of the sphere radius with the parameter edgeTol. A tolerance value of 1.0 positions theplane down the center of the sphere. A tolerance value of 0.5 defines the longitudinal plane halfway between the center and the outside edge of thesphere. The default value is .9, so that almost half the sphere is in front of the plane. The orientToEye parameter determines whether the plane isperpendicular to the eye, or perpendicular to the sphere's Z axis. Setting that parameter to TRUE (the default) specifies that the plane be perpendicular tothe eye, which is most often the desired behavior.

<dd>The default view volume is undefined, and the working space is identity.

<dt>~SbSphereSectionProjector()
<dd>Destructor.

<dt>void setTolerance(float edgeTol)
<dt>float getTolerance() const
<dd>Set and get the edge tolerance as a fraction of the radius of the sphere. If this is 1.0, the projector is a hemisphere. If this is .1, the projector is a slice of the sphere with radius .1*radius. Default is .9.

<dt>void setRadialFactor(float radialFactor = 0.0)
<dt>float getRadialFactor() const
<dd>Set and get the radial rotation factor. When the mouse is dragged off theedge of the sphere, the mouse motion can be classified as either tangential (moving in a circle around the sphere) or radial (moving toward or awayfrom the center). The tangential motion will always map to a rotation around the center, (like the hands of a clock). The radial motion, by default,has no effect. But if you set the radialFactor to be &gt; 0.0, this motion will make the sphere rotate as if the mouse is pulling the top of the sphere outtoward the mouse. If radialFactor = 1.0, then pulling has a `normal' feel (that is, the mouse motion causes the same amount of rotation as if you hadrotated by hitting the actual surface of the sphere). Default is 0.0

<dt>SbBool isWithinTolerance(const SbVec3f &point)
<dd>Find whether this point on the sphere or tolerance plane is within tolerance.
