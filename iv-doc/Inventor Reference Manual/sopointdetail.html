<dt>NAME
<dd>SoPointDetail -- stores detail information about vertex-based shapes made of points

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>This class contains detail information about a point in a vertex-based shape made of points. It is used for returning information about an intersection with or primitives generated by a set of points. It is also used by SoFaceDetail and SoLineDetail to return information about the vertices of faces and line segments.

<dt>METHODS
<dl>
<dt><b>SoPointDetail</b>()
<dt>virtual ~<b>SoPointDetail</b>()
<dd>Constructor and destructor.

<dt>long <b>getCoordinateIndex</b>() const
<dd>Returns the index of the point within the relevant coordinate node.

<dt>long <b>getMaterialIndex</b>() const
<dd>Returns the index of the material for the point within the relevant material node.

<dt>long getNormalIndex() const
<dd>Returns the index of the surface normal at the point within the relevant normal node. Note that if normals have been generated for a shape, the index may not be into an existing normal node.

<dt>long getTextureCoordIndex() const
<dd>Returns the index of the texture coordinates for the point within the relevant normal node. Note that if texture coordinates have been generatedfor a shape, the index may not be into an existing texture coordinate node.
