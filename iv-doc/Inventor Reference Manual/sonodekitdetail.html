This consists of a pointer to

the nodekit, a pointer to the child part within the nodekit, and the name of thechild part.

During a pick action, each nodekit along the picked path creates its ownSoNodeKitDetail. Together, the full set of details gives you complete picture of the pickpath. Since nodekits have hidden children (See the reference page for SoBaseKit), aregular SoPath ends at the topmost nodekit in the path. If you cast the pickpath

from an SoPath pointer to an SoNodeKitPath pointer, you can then retrieve allnodekits along the path and examine their corresponding details.
