<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>This node represents a simple capped cylinder centered around the y-axis. B
default, the cylinder is centered at (0,0,0) and has a default size of -1 to +1 in allthree dimensions. You can use the radius and height fields to create a cylinder with a different size. The cylinder is transformed by the current cumulative transformation and is drawnwith the current lighting model, drawing style, material, and geometric complexity.

<p>If the current material binding is PER_PART or PER_PART_INDEXED, the firstcurrent material is used for the sides of the cylinder, the second is used for the top, and the third is used for the bottom. Otherwise, the first material is used for theentire cylinder.

<p>When a texture is applied to a cylinder, it is applied differently to the sides, top, andbottom. On the sides, the texture wraps counterclockwise (from above) starting at the back of the cylinder. The texture has a vertical seam at the back, intersecting theyz-plane. For the top and bottom, a circle is cut out of the texture square and applied to the top or bottom circle. The top texture appears right side up when thetop of the cylinder is tilted toward the camera, and the bottom texture appears right side up when the top of the cylinder is tilted away from the camera. 

<dt>FIELDS
<dl>
<dt>SoSFBitMask parts
<dd>Visible parts of cylinder.
<dt>SoSFFloat radius
<dt>SoSFFloat height

<dt>METHODS
<dl>
<dt><b>SoCylinder</b>()
<dd>Creates a cylinder node with default settings.

<dt>void <b>addPart</b>(SoCylinder::Part part)
<dt>void <b>removePart</b>(SoCylinder::Part part)
<dd>These are convenience functions that make it easy to turn on or off a part ofthe cylinder.

<dt>SbBool <b>hasPart</b>(SoCylinder::Part part) const
<dd>This convenience function returns whether a given part is on or off.
<dt>static SoType <b>getClassTypeId</b>()
<dd>Returns type identifier for this class.

<dt><b>Methods from class SoNode</b>:
<dd>setOverride, isOverride, copy, affectsState, getByName, getByName

<dt><b>Methods from class SoFieldContainer</b>:
<dd>setToDefaults, hasDefaultValues, fieldsAreEqual, copyFieldValues, set, get,getFields, getField, getFieldName, enableNotify, isNotifyEnabled

<dt><b>Methods from class SoBase</b>:
<dd>ref, unref, unrefNoDelete, touch, getTypeId, isOfType, setName, getName
</dl>

<dt>ACTION BEHAVIORS
<dl>
<dt>GLRenderAction
<dd>Draws cylinder based on the current coordinates, materials, drawing style,and so on.

<dt>SoRayPickAction
<dd>Intersects the ray with the cylinder. The part of the cylinder that was picked is available from the SoCylinderDetail.

<dt>SoGetBoundingBoxAction
<dd>Computes the bounding box that encloses the cylinder.

<dt>SoCallbackAction
<dd>If any triangle callbacks are registered with the action, they will be invoked for each successive triangle that approximates the cylinder.
