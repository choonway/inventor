<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>SbSpherePlaneProjector projects a window space point (usually based on the mouse location) onto a surface defined by a sphere and plane cutting through the sphere.Two projected points can produce a rotation about the sphere's center. When the mouse position projects onto the plane, the rotations will be as if the plane is beingdragged, causing the sphere to roll beneath it.

<p>Incremental changes (delta rotation) can be computed during interactive sessions.Sphere projectors are typically used to write interactive 3D manipulators and viewers.

<dt>METHODS
<dl>
<dt><b>SbSpherePlaneProjector(float edgeTol = .9, SbBool orientToEye= TRUE)</b>
<dt><b>SbSpherePlaneProjector(const SbSphere &amp;sph, float edgeTol = .9, SbBool orientToEye = TRUE)</b>
<dd>Constructors. The first uses a default sphere centered at the origin with radius 1.0; the sphere is supplied in the second. The position of the plane is specified as a fraction of the sphere radius with the parameter edgeTol. A tolerance value of 1.0 positions the plane down the center of the sphere. A tolerance value of 0.5 defines the longitudinal plane halfway between the center and the outside edge of the sphere. The default value is .9, so that almost half the sphere is in front of the plane. The orientToEye parameter determines whether the plane is perpendicular to the eye, or perpendicular to the sphere's Z axis. Setting that parameter to TRUE (the default) specifies that the plane be perpendicular to the eye, which is most often the desired behavior.

<p>The default view volume is undefined, and the working space is identity.
