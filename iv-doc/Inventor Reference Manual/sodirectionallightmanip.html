direction INHERITS FROMSoBase &gt; SoFieldContainer &gt; SoNode &gt; SoLight &gt; SoDirectionalLight &gt;

SoDirectionalLightManip DESCRIPTIONSoDirectionalLightManip is the base class for all SoDirectionalLight nodes that

have a built-in 3D user interface (this is the only such class provided with theInventor toolkit). Since it is derived from SoDirectionalLight, any changes to its fields result in a change of lighting for nodes that follow it in the scene graph. Inthis case, the interface edits the direction field. Also, the color of the manipulator's geometry will reflect the color of the light (but you cannot edit the color using thismanipulator).

Typically, you will want to replace a regular SoDirectionalLight with anSoDirectionalLightManip (as when the user selects a light to be edited), or vice versa (as when the user is done moving the light and the interface should go away).Use the replaceNode() method to insert a manipulator into a scene graph, and the replaceManip() method to remove it when done. The SoDirectionalLightManip utilizes an SoDirectionalLightDragger to provide a3D interface. However, the manipulator differs from the dragger; it lights other objects in the scene because, as an SoDirectionalLight, it alters the state. The fieldvalues and movement of the dragger, on the other hand, affect only the dragger itself. To find out more about how the interface works and what each part will do,see the reference page for SoDirectionalLightDragger. The interfaces of the dragger and the manipulator are identical. The SoDirectionalLightManip utilizes its dragger by adding it as a hidden child.When an action is applied to the manipulator, such as rendering or handling events, the manipulator first traverses the dragger, and then the manipulator addsits lighting parameters to the state. When you click-drag-release over the manipulator, it passes these events down to the dragger, which moves as a result (&quot;Ican't help it, I'm a dragger!&quot;).

The manipulator maintains consistency between the fields of the dragger and itsown fields. Let's say you use the mouse to rotate the dragger. Callbacks ensure that the direction field of the manipulator will change by the same amount, thuschanging the lighting of nodes which follow in the scene graph. Similarly, if you set the direction field of the SoDirectionalLightManip, the manipulator will orientthe dragger accordingly.

SSooDDiirreeccttiioonnaallLLiigghhttMMaanniipphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Because the dragger is a hidden child, you can see the dragger on screen and interactwith it, but the dragger does not show up when you write the manipulator to file. Also, any SoPath will end at the manipulator. (See the Actions section of thisreference page for a complete description of when the dragger is traversed).

If you want to get a pointer to the dragger you can get it from the manipulatorusing the getDragger() method. You will need to do this if you want to change the geometry of a manipulator, since the geometry actually belongs to the dragger. FIELDS Fields from class SoDirectionalLight:

direction Fields from class SoLight:

on, intensity, color

METHODS SoDirectionalLightManip()

Constructor. SoDragger * getDragger()Returns a pointer to the dragger being used by this manipulator. Given this

pointer, you can customize the dragger just like you would any otherdragger. You can change geometry using the setPart() method, or add callbacks using the methods found in the SoDragger reference page. SbBool replaceNode(SoPath *p )Replaces the tail of the path with this manipulator. The tail of the path must

be an SoDirectionalLight node (or subclass thereof). If the path has anodekit, this will try to use setPart() to insert the manipulator. Otherwise, the manipulator requires that the next to last node in the path chain be agroup.

The field values from the directional light node will be copied to thismanipulator, and the light node will be replaced. The manipulator will not call ref() on the node it is replacing. The old nodewill disappear if it has no references other than from the input path p and its parent, since this manipulator will be replacing it in both of those places.Nor will the manipulator make any changes to field connections of the old node. The calling process is thus responsible for keeping track of its ownnodes and field connections.

SbBool replaceManip(SoPath *p, SoDirectionalLight *newOne ) constReplaces the tail of the path, which must be this manipulator, with the

given SoDirectionalLight node. If the path has a nodekit, this will try to usesetPart() to insert the new node. Otherwise, the manipulator requires that the next to last node in the path chain be a group. The field values from the manipulator will be copied to the directional lightnode, and the manipulator will be replaced.

The manipulator will not call ref() or unref() on the node which is replacingit, nor will it make any changes to field connections. The calling process is thus responsible for keeping track of its own nodes and field connections. static SoType getClassTypeId()Returns type identifier for this class.

Methods from class SoNode:

setOverride, isOverride, copy, affectsState, getByName, getByName

Methods from class SoFieldContainer:

setToDefaults, hasDefaultValues, fieldsAreEqual, copyFieldValues, set, get,getFields, getField, getFieldName, enableNotify, isNotifyEnabled

Methods from class SoBase:

ref, unref, unrefNoDelete, touch, getTypeId, isOfType, setName, getName

ACTION BEHAVIORSoGLRenderAction, SoCallbackAction, SoGetBoundingBoxAction,

SoGetMatrixAction, SoHandleEventAction, SoRayPickActionFirst, traverses the dragger the way an SoGroup would. All draggers place

themselves in space, but leave the current transformation unchanged whenfinished. Then the SoDirectionalLightManip adds a directional light to the state just like its base class, SoDirectionalLight. SoSearchActionSearches just like an SoDirectionalLight. Does not search the dragger,

which is a hidden child. SoWriteActionWrites out just like an SoDirectionalLight. Does not write the dragger,

which is a hidden child. If you really need to write valuable informationabout the dragger, such as customized geometry, you can retrieve the dragger with the getDragger() method and then write it out separately.
