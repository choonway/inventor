<dt>NAME
<dd>SoPrimitiveVertex -- represents a vertex of a generated primitive

<dt>INHERITS FROM
<dd>SoPrimitiveVertex

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>An SoPrimitiveVertex represents a vertex of a primitive (triangle, line segment, or point) that is being generated by an SoCallbackAction. It contains an object-spacepoint, normal, texture coordinates, material index, and a pointer to an instance of an SoDetail subclass. This detail may contain more information about the vertex, ormay be a NULL pointer if there is no such info.

<p>Instances of SoPrimitiveVertex are typically created on the stack by shape classeswhile they are generating primitives. Anyone who wants to save them as return values from SoCallbackAction should probably make copies of them.

<dt>METHODS
<dl>
<dt><b>SoPrimitiveVertex</b>()
<dt><b>SoPrimitiveVertex</b>(const SoPrimitiveVertex &pv)
<dt>~SoPrimitiveVertex()
<dd>Constructors and destructor. Note that copying a primitive vertex copies thedetail pointer, and not the detail itself.

<dt>const SbVec3f & <b>getPoint</b>() const
<dt>const SbVec3f & <b>getNormal</b>() const
<dt>const SbVec4f & <b>getTextureCoords</b>() const
<dd>These return the surface point, normal, and texture coordinates in object space.

<dt>int <b>getMaterialIndex</b>() const
<dd>Returns the index into the current set of materials of the material active at the vertex.

<dt>const SoDetail * <b>getDetail</b>() const
<dd>Returns the detail giving more information about the vertex. Note that this pointer may be NULL if there is no more info.

<dt>SoPrimitiveVertex &<b>operator =</b>(const SoPrimitiveVertex &pv)
<dd>Copies the given vertex. Note that just the pointer to the detail is copied,and not the detail itself.
