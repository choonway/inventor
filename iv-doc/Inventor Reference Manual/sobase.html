<dt>NAME
<dd>SoBase -- base class for all nodes, paths, and engines

<dt>INHERITS FROM
<dd>SoBase

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>Abstract base class for Inventor node, path, and engine classes. This class handles reference counting, notification, and naming.

<dt>METHODS

<dl>
<dt>void <b>ref</b>()
<dt>void <b>unref</b>() const
<dt>void <b>unrefNoDelete</b>() const

<dd>Adds and removes a reference to an instance. Instances should be referencedwhen they will be used outside of the routine in which they were initialized. (A typical example of this is maintaining a pointer to the root of a graph.)Whenever the reference count for an instance is decremented to 0, the instance is automatically destroyed by the database (unless unrefNoDelete()is used to unref it). The reference count of a node is automatically incremented when the node is added as a child of another node or when apath points to the node. Likewise, the reference count is automatically decremented when the node is removed as a child or when a path thatpoints to the node is changed or destroyed.

<p>unrefNoDelete() should be called when it is desired to decrement thereference count, but not delete the instance if this brings the reference count to zero. This is most useful in returning an object to a zero-reference-count state, like it was when it was created by new.

<dt>void <b>touch</b>()
<dd>Marks an instance as modified, simulating a change to it. This will notify
auditors (parent nodes, connected engines, and so on) of a change to thisobject and cause attached sensors to be triggered.

<dt>static SoType <b>getClassTypeId</b>()
<dd>Returns type identifier for this class.

<dt>virtual SoType <b>getTypeId</b>() const
<dd>Returns the type identifier for a specific instance.

<dt><a href="sbbool.html">SbBool</a> <B>isOfType</b>(SoType type) const
<dd>Returns TRUE if this object is of the type specified in type or is derived from that type. Otherwise, it returns FALSE. For example:

<dl>
<dd>nodePtr-&gt;isOfType(SoGroup::getClassTypeId()) </dl>

<p>returns TRUE if nodePtr is an instance of SoGroup or one of its subclasses.

<dt>virtual void <b>setName</b>(const SbName &amp;name)
<dd>Sets the name of an instance. Object names are preserved when objects are written to or read from files.

<dt>virtual const SbName&amp; <b>getName</b>() const
<dd>Returns the name of an instance. If the instance has not been named, anempty SbName is returned. Objects that are named can be looked up using the getByName() methods of SoNode, SoEngine, or SoPath.
