SSooGGeettMMaattrriixxAAccttiioonnhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh NAME SoGetMatrixAction -- computes transformation matrix for subgraph INHERITS FROMSoAction &gt; SoGetMatrixAction DESCRIPTIONThis action computes transformation matrices for a given subgraph. It computes the

cumulative transformation matrix and its inverse, along with a cumulative texturetransformation matrix and its inverse.

This action is unlike most others in that it does not traverse downwards fromgroups. When applied to a node, it computes the matrix for just that node. (This makes sense for transformation nodes, but not for others, really.) It is much moreuseful when applied to a path. When applied to a path, it gathers the transformation info for all nodes in the path and those that affect nodes in thepath, but it stops when it hits the last node in the path; it does not traverse downwards from it as other actions (such as rendering) do. This behavior makes themost sense for this action.

METHODS SoGetMatrixAction(const SbViewportRegion &newRegion)

Constructor takes viewport region to use for picking. Even though thematrix computation may not involve a window per se, some nodes need this information to determine their placement. void setViewportRegion(const SbViewportRegion &newRegion)const SbViewportRegion &

getViewportRegion() constSets/returns current viewport region to use for action.

SbMatrix & getMatrix()SbMatrix & getInverse()

Returns cumulative transformation matrix and its inverse. SbMatrix & getTextureMatrix()SbMatrix & getTextureInverse()

Returns cumulative texture transformation matrix and its inverse. Methods from class SoAction:
