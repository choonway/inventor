SSooMMFFPPllaanneehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh NAME SoMFPlane -- field containing several plane equations INHERITS FROMSoField &gt; SoMField &gt; SoMFPlane DESCRIPTIONA field containing one or more plane equations.

SoMFPlanes are written to file as groups of four floating point values separated bywhitespace. In each set of four values, the first three are the normal direction of the plane, the fourth is the distance of the plane from the origin (in the direction of thenormal).

When more than one value is present, all of the values are enclosed in squarebrackets and separated by commas; for example:

[ 1 0 0 0, .707 .707 0 100, ]

METHODSstatic SoType getClassTypeId()

virtual void getTypeId() constReturns the type for this class or a particular object of this class.

SbPlane operator [ ](int i) constReturns the i'th value of the field. Indexing past the end of the field (passing

in i greater than getNum()) will return garbage. const SbPlane * getValues(int start) constReturns a pointer into the array of values in the field, starting at index start.

The values are read-only; see the startEditing()/finishEditing() methods fora way of modifying values in place.

int find(SbPlane targetValue, SbBool addIfNotFound = FALSE)Finds the given value in the array and returns the index of that value in the

array. If the value is not found, -1 is returned. If addIfNotFound is set, thentargetValue is added to the end of the array (but -1 is still returned).

void setValues(int start, int num, const SbPlane *newValues)Sets num values starting at index start to the values in newValues. The array

will be automatically be made larger to accomodate the new values, ifnecessary.

SSooMMFFPPllaanneehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh void set1Value(int index, SbPlane newValue)Sets the index'th value in the array to newValue. The array will be

automatically expanded, if necessary. SbPlane operator =(SbPlane newValue)void setValue(SbPlane newValue)

Sets the first value in the array to newValue, and deletes the second andsubsequent values.

int operator ==(const SoMFPlane &f) constint operator !=(const SoMFPlane &f) const

Returns TRUE if all of the values of this field equal (do not equal) those ofthe given field. If the fields are different types FALSE will always be returned (even if one field is an SoMFFloat with one value of 1.0 and the other is anSoMFInt with a value of 1, for example).

SbPlane * startEditing()void finishEditing()

startEditing() returns a pointer to the internally-maintained array that canbe modified. The values in the array may be changed, but values cannot be added or removed. It is illegal to call any other editing methods betweenstartEditing() and finishEditing() (e.g. set1Value(), setValue(), etc).

Fields, engines or sensors connected to this field and sensors are not notifiedthat this field has changed until finishEditing() is called. Calling finishEditing() always sets the isDefault() flag to FALSE and informsengines and sensors that the field changed, even if none of the values actually were changed.
