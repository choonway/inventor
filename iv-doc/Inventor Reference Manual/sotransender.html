<dt>NAME
<dd>SoTranSender -- sends database changes for transcription

<dt>INHERITS FROM
<dd>SoTranSender

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>This class is used for transcribing Inventor data. Transcription is the process of packaging changes to a database and sending them over a &quot;wire&quot; to another database.

<p>The SoTranSender class is used on the sending side of transcription. It packages upchanges to a Inventor database into a file or memory area defined by an SoOutput instance. It supports a limited set of changes to a database; each change is stored as a command in the transcription area. The SoTranReceiver class can be used at the other end to interpret the transcribed commands.

<dt>METHODS
<dl>
<dt><b>SoTranSender</b>(SoOutput *output)
<dd>The constructor takes a pointer to an SoOutput instance that determineswhat the transcription area is (file or memory).

<dt>~<b>SoTranSender</b>()
<dd>Destructor.

<dt>SoOutput * <b>getOutput</b>() const
<dd>Returns pointer to current SoOutput instance.

<dt>void <b>insert</b>(SoNode *node)
<dd>Adds an INSERT command to the transcription area. The given node will be added as the last child of the root node on the receiving end.

<dt>void <b>insert</b>(SoNode *node, SoNode *parent, int n)
<dd>Adds an INSERT command to the transcription area. The given node will be added as the nth child of the given parent node on the receiving end. A NULL parent node causes the node to be added to the receiving end's root node.

<dt>void <b>remove</b>(SoNode *parent, int n)
Adds a REMOVE command to the transcription area. The nth child of the given (non-NULL) parent node on the receiving end will be removed.

<dt>void <b>replace</b>(SoNode *parent, int n, SoNode *newNode)
<dd>Adds a REPLACE command to the transcription area. The nth child of the given (non-NULL) parent node on the receiving end will be replaced with newNode.

<dt>void <b>modify</b>(SoNode *node)
<dd>Adds a MODIFY command to the transcription area. Updates the field data for the given node to the new contents. Note that this changes only fielddata; children of groups are not affected, nor is any non-field instance data.

<dt>void <b>prepareToSend</b>()Prepares a SoTranSender instance for transcription, making sure the transcription area is complete and all packaged to go. This must be called before the transcription can be performed.
