SSooMMFFSShhoorrtthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh NAME SoMFShort -- multiple-value field containing any number of short integers INHERITS FROMSoField &gt; SoMField &gt; SoMFShort DESCRIPTIONA multiple-value field that contains any number of short (16-bit) integers.

SoMFShorts are written to file as one or more short integer values, represented asdecimal, hexadecimal (beginning with '0x') or octal (beginning with '0') values. When more than one value is present, all of the values are enclosed in squarebrackets and separated by commas; for example:

[ -7, 0xFF, -033 ]

METHODSstatic SoType getClassTypeId()

virtual void getTypeId() constReturns the type for this class or a particular object of this class.

short operator [ ](int i) constReturns the i'th value of the field. Indexing past the end of the field (passing

in i greater than getNum()) will return garbage. const short * getValues(int start) constReturns a pointer into the array of values in the field, starting at index start.

The values are read-only; see the startEditing()/finishEditing() methods fora way of modifying values in place.

int find(short targetValue, SbBool addIfNotFound = FALSE)Finds the given value in the array and returns the index of that value in the

array. If the value is not found, -1 is returned. If addIfNotFound is set, thentargetValue is added to the end of the array (but -1 is still returned).

void setValues(int start, int num, const short *newValues)Sets num values starting at index start to the values in newValues. The array

will be automatically be made larger to accomodate the new values, ifnecessary.

void set1Value(int index, short newValue)Sets the index'th value in the array to newValue. The array will be

automatically expanded, if necessary.

short operator =(short newValue)void setValue(short newValue)

Sets the first value in the array to newValue, and deletes the second andsubsequent values.

int operator ==(const SoMFShort &f) constint operator !=(const SoMFShort &f) const

Returns TRUE if all of the values of this field equal (do not equal) those ofthe given field. If the fields are different types FALSE will always be returned (even if one field is an SoMFFloat with one value of 1.0 and the other is anSoMFInt with a value of 1, for example).

short * startEditing()void finishEditing()

startEditing() returns a pointer to the internally-maintained array that canbe modified. The values in the array may be changed, but values cannot be added or removed. It is illegal to call any other editing methods betweenstartEditing() and finishEditing() (e.g. set1Value(), setValue(), etc).

Fields, engines or sensors connected to this field and sensors are not notifiedthat this field has changed until finishEditing() is called. Calling finishEditing() always sets the isDefault() flag to FALSE and informsengines and sensors that the field changed, even if none of the values actually were changed.
