<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>This node represents a sphere. By default, the sphere is centered at the origin and has a radius of 1. The sphere is transformed by the current cumulativetransformation and is drawn with the current lighting model, drawing style, material, and geometric complexity. A sphere does not have faces or parts. Therefore, the sphere ignores material andnormal bindings, using the first material for the entire sphere and using its own normals. When a texture is applied to a sphere, the texture covers the entire surface,wrapping counterclockwise from the back of the sphere. The texture has a seam at the back on the yz-plane.

<dt>FIELDS
<dl>
<dt>SoSFFloat radius
<dd>Radius of sphere. This must be greater than 0.

<dt>ACTION BEHAVIOR

<dl>
<dt>SoGLRenderAction
<dd>Draws sphere based on the current coordinates, materials, drawing style, andso on.

<dt>SoRayPickAction

<dd>Computes the bounding box that encloses the sphere.

<dt>SoCallbackAction
<dd>If any triangle callbacks are registered with the action, they will be invoked for each successive triangle that approximates the sphere.
