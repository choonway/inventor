<dd>SbSphereProjector -- sphere projector

<dd><a href="sbprojector.html">SbProjector</a> &gt; SbSphereProjector

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>SbSphereProjector is an abstract base class for projectors that use a sphere in their projection. Sphere projectors are typically used to write interactive 3D manipulators and viewers.

<dt>METHODS
<dl>
<dt>SbVec3f projectAndGetRotation(const SbVec2f &amp;point, SbRotation &amp;rot)
<dd>Apply the projector using the given point, returning the point in three dimensions that it projects to. This also returns in rot a rotation on the surface of the sphere from the last projected point to this one. The passed point should be normalized (i.e. lie in the range [0.0,1.0]), with (0,0) at thelower-left.

<dt>virtual SbRotation getRotation(const SbVec3f &amp;point1, const SbVec3f &amp;point2)

<dd>Get a rotation given two points on this sphere projector. The rotation will be on the surface of the sphere.

<dt>void setSphere(const SbSphere &sph)
<dt>const SbSphere &getSphere() const
<dd>Set and get the sphere on which to project points. The default sphere has radius 1.0.

<dt>void setOrientToEye(SbBool orientToEye)
<dt>SbBool isOrientToEye() const
<dd>Set and get whether the projector should always be oriented towards the eye.Set to FALSE if the tolerance should be evaluated in working space.

<dt>void setFront(SbBool isFront)
<dt>SbBool isFront() const
<dd>SbBool isPointInFront(const SbVec3f &point) const
<dd>Set and get whether the projector should intersect the half of the sphere that faces the eye. Set to FALSE if the projector should intersect with the rearhalf.
